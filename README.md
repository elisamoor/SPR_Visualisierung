# SPR Visualisierung
Digital Humanities Abschlussprojekt HS2024.
This project visualizes reaction time data from my master thesis (Moor, 2024), stemming from a self-paced reading experiment. The aim is to allow the users to delve into the dataset by visualising the reaction times depending on factors (such as sentences, i.e. the stimuli, age, gender or education of participants), that users can choose from dropdown menus. The visualisation shows the sentence, whereby the length of the words correspond to the mean reaction times associated with that word under certain conditions (filtered dataset).
